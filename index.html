              <h3>History of Skelerun</h3>
              <p>In 2035, Elon Musk became the first human to set foot on Mars. However, the Red Planet harbored secrets that nobody could anticipate. Not ten minutes after his first step, a vortex of dust arose from beneath his feet, blocking him from view. When the storm settled down, the Elongated Muskrat had disappeared entirely. Rovers searched for a body for weeks, with nothing to show for it. The public forgot, and eventually moved on. Years later, the Space Force sent a colony of people to live on Mars. On the third week, the Skull of Elon rose in the West and transformed all those who let the Eternal Flame go out into monstrous trees, so that they may provide the kindling for the flame in the future. When footage of the atrocity reached Earth, all hopes of colonizing the Red Planet vanished, and the years passed by without another colonization attempt. As millenia passed, the Musk family line searched in vain for a way to take their patriarch back from the hellish underworld his soul was trapped in. Generation after generation of Muskets made their pilgrimage to Mars in futile attempts to bring peace to his spirit, but they too were turned to tree. The year is now 4057. You, Sans Musk, have reached adulthood and now must run the Gauntlet of Fire to prove your worth to your ancestor, and put an end to his reign of terror. Little do you know, he has waited for you, and plans on possessing your body and leaving you to suffer as a specter in his place...</p>

              <p>Use WASD as arrow keys to navigate through the field. Use the Shift key to collect wood, and also to deposit the wood into the fire when you have obtained at least 10 wood. Don't let the fire go out! A successful wood deposit will give you seven more seconds of fire, but watch out for the Flying Skull!</p>
